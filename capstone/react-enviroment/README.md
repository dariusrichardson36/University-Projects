# Capstone Project: Scentopedia

Scentopedia is a web application that allows users to explore fragrances, save their favorites, interact with a chatbot, and locate physical stores where they can purchase these fragrances. This project was developed as part of my capstone for the Computer Science program at the University of Texas at Tyler.

## Features
- **Fragrance Discovery**: Users can browse a wide collection of fragrances with detailed information.
- **User Accounts**: Create accounts to save favorite fragrances and manage wishlists.
- **Store Locator**: Find nearby stores that stock selected fragrances with a customizable distance filter.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Users can interact with a chatbot for quick navigation and assistance on the website.
- **Desktop-Only Design**: The website is optimized for desktop use with no support for mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore
- **Tools**: Vite (for development environment)
- **UI/UX Framework**: Lucide for icons

## Challenges and Learning
This project provided me with valuable experience in:
